# rest-api-courses

I constructed a REST API that allows intstructors to access a courses database. Users are authenticated and validation is provided for course creation, editing, and deletion. This project was built using Express, a SQLite database and the Sequelize ORM as well as the Postman API development environment.

The RESTAPI.postman_collection.json file can be uploaded to Postman in order to view the routes and use the user authentication [Postman] https://www.getpostman.com/ <br/>
To install dependencies use the package manager [npm]https://www.npmjs.com/:

```
npm install
```

To start a development server:

```
npm start
```
